Determining Student Satisfaction using Data Analysis

Abstract
Education took a big hit after the COVID-19 pandemic, and it became necessary to understand the student’s perspective on education, schooling, and understandability.
It has become crucial to collect feedback from the students for the university’s betterment and scope of improvement. From feedback data, data mining can assist in finding
areas for improvement and satisfaction. From the feedback responses, significant concepts and topics can be extracted using text-mining tools.The feedback form and its
comments are useful resources that can be classified as favorable, negative, or neutral by sentiment analysis to offer more details about areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.
To detect common trends and patterns and get insight into particular requirements and preferences, clustering methods can group findings based on feedback answers.
Therefore, data is collected in the raw form of feedback data and then filtered, cleaned, and classified based on the requirement. The clustering and association method 
is applied and then analyzed for the results. The results can be used to guide decision-making and enhance students’ learning experiences once patterns and themes have been found.
For instance, if a certain course consistently gets negative feedback, adjustments can be made to enhance the course’s content or delivery.

Aim
The project focuses on understanding and determining student satisfaction through data analysis of collected online feedback. The important areas include data collection, data cleaning,
attribute selection, data mining tool selection, analysis to find out on what attributes student satisfaction depends on, clustering, and association analysis, and using the analysis 
results to give suggestions to the educational institutions. Which area needs to be improved, which area the students are most satisfied with, and how these determine students’ overall 
satisfaction can be explained as “Data mining turns a large collection of data into knowledge.”

Conclusion
- Academic attributes of the university showed how most of the student’s satisfaction was dependent on those, therefore signifying the importance of academic attributes and the
   necessity to keep up the good quality in that area to keep the students in.
- Attributes like recommendation likeliness, course clarity, classroom interaction, teaching quality, and extracurricular activities need constant maintenance and improvement for
   the University to maintain high student satisfaction.
- Attributes like communication availability, library availability, academic advisers, cleanliness, accommodation, and course curriculum are the attributes that show mediocre correlation.
   That being said, to keep student satisfaction high these areas need to be taken care of and given high importance to increase student satisfaction.
- Attributes like online platforms, prompt feedback, and student support services have a low correlation with student satisfaction. Therefore universities can pay low attention to these
   areas.
- To conclude, all the attributes combine and give high student satisfaction but the major contributors were recommendation likeliness, course clarity, classroom interaction,
   teaching quality, and extracurricular activities.
